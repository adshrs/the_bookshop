				<p> Technology has influenced people around the globe. As technology has
					developed it has given new lease of life to humankind. Considering the
					prior life of humans, the development of technology has brought a vast
					change in our lives being highly significant in today’s era. From the
					barbarian era to the modern era, human civilization has evolved
					profoundly in the context of technology. Over many years, the
					rapid progress of technology has definitely made our life faster and
					more convenient.
					<br><br>
					21st century, the era of science and technology has given
					rise to the digital world. One of the greatest innovations of science and technology is the internet. It has provided a wide range of services. Services like instant messaging, sharing information, and accessing various information. Similarly, inventions like cell phones and other
					high-tech gear have taken over today’s world. From carrying out our
					daily life activities to learning we people have been using these
					technologies to the fullest. Many applications which are used for
					learning are highly effective. It has not only made education easier but
					also entertaining; somehow colorful. It can be considered a source of
					entertainment as well.
					<br><br>
					Although development in science and technology have brought us
					many advantages, we cannot omit the association of it with negative
					impacts. We can witness that these days, technologies have been
					cramping the social development of children. We see them so indulged
					in their devices. The Internet itself is a small word but the environment
					it has created is huge. And within this environment, there reside many
					people. We must always draw a line to be safe from its detrimental
					effects.
					In conclusion, technology has many beneficial effects when is
					used wisely. Contrary to this we cannot alter the outcome. It makes our

					life pleasant and safer if we utilize it properly. Technology is indeed the
					greatest boon to mankind.
